### Glossary

2. Yoco - A company that helps business integrate Payment Gateway for online to process online payments.
3. Script - A piece of code that is programmed to performs a task/job when executed.


### Set Up - How it works

- Register a Yoco Business Account to get started [Yoco Business Portal](https://www.yoco.com/za/yoco-link/)
- Complete your profile by setting up the business details, directors id, etc
- Navigate to "Sell Online" and Click on Payment Links
- The RPA script will be initiated and it will start executing.
- The script will automatically open the Chrome browser, login to the Yoco Business Portal using the email and password configured,
then navigate to the Sell Online -> Payment Links.
- It will proceed to automatically click on the Send Payment Link, type in the name of the member and amount of the membership they supposed to pay,
then copy the unique payment link generated by Yoco Portal, and finally close the browser and send the payment link via email to the member.
- Once the script is done, it will save the payment link to a .csv/excelsheet.


### Membership Payment Online Process.

1. The Payment Link generated is attached to the email sent the member, and the member will click on it where they will be redirected to a payment page.
2. The payment page will contain input areas where they will have to securely type in their credit/debit card details and submit it.
3. Once submitted, Yoco will process the payment details and deduct the membership fee from the member and then transfer the amount to the business account.
4. Yoco will apply a charge fee of 2.9% for securely processing the payment. Thus, if the amount is R350 then R350 - R10,50 = R339,5.
5. The payment link will then no longer available or accessable, as it will expired once the payment has been processed successfully.

### FAQ
